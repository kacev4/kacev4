🔬 Data Analyst & Marine Scientist 🔍

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Kiara and I'm a marine science M.Sc. student with a strong data analysis and visualization foundation 
and a passion for exploring data-driven insights beyond the world of marine biology. My journey encompasses fieldwork, data wrangling, 
and conducting thorough statistical analyses to extract meaningful insights.

🌊 What You'll Find Here:

    📊 Data Analysis: From wrangling large datasets to diving deep into statistical analyses, I'm all about 
    uncovering patterns and extracting actionable insights.

    📈 Data Visualization: I specialize in presenting intricate information in clear, visually captivating ways 
    using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and more. (But it all started with R!)

    🌐 Research Adventures: Explore marine science/environmental research, alongside my ventures into other sectors 
    where data analysis plays a crucial role.

    📝 Scientific Communication: As a skilled communicator, I love translating data-driven narratives into impactful 
    written (and spoken) presentations. (Soon to come...)

  
  🐍 Tech Toolbox: R, Excel, SQL, Power BI, and some Python.

  🌎 Fluent in English & Spanish.
